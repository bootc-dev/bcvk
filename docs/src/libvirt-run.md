# Libvirt Integration Concepts

Libvirt integration provides persistent, production-ready virtual machine management for bootc containers. This guide covers the concepts, workflows, and architectural patterns for using bcvk with libvirt.

## What is Libvirt Integration?

Libvirt integration transforms bootc containers into persistent virtual machines managed by the libvirt virtualization API. Unlike ephemeral VMs, these are full-featured virtual machines suitable for production workloads.

### Key Characteristics

**Persistent Lifecycle**: VMs continue to exist between host reboots
**Professional Management**: Full libvirt API and tooling support
**Production Ready**: Enterprise-grade virtualization features
**Hardware Integration**: Direct access to host hardware resources

### Libvirt vs Ephemeral VMs

**Libvirt VMs**:
- Persistent storage and configuration
- Survive host reboots
- Full VM lifecycle management
- Enterprise features (snapshots, migration, monitoring)
- Production workload suitability

**Ephemeral VMs**:
- Temporary, testing-focused
- Automatic cleanup
- Development and debugging
- Quick iteration cycles

## Integration Architecture

### How bcvk Works with Libvirt

1. **Container Analysis**: bcvk analyzes the container image

3. **VM Definition**: Creates libvirt domain XML configuration
4. **Resource Allocation**: Configures CPU, memory, and storage
5. **Network Setup**: Establishes network connectivity
6. **VM Registration**: Registers VM with libvirt daemon

### Storage Integration

**Storage Pools**: Libvirt storage pools manage VM disk images
**Volume Management**: Automatic volume creation and lifecycle
**Format Support**: QCOW2, raw, and other disk formats
**Snapshot Capability**: Built-in snapshot and backup features

### Network Integration

**Virtual Networks**: Integration with libvirt network management
**Bridge Networking**: Direct host network integration
**Isolated Networks**: Secure network segmentation

## When to Use Libvirt Integration

### Production Workloads

Libvirt integration is ideal for:
- **Server applications**: Long-running services and daemons
- **Database systems**: Persistent data storage requirements
- **Web services**: Production web applications and APIs
- **Enterprise applications**: Business-critical workloads

### Development Infrastructure

Use libvirt VMs for:
- **Persistent development environments**: Long-term development setups
- **Shared development resources**: Multi-user development platforms
- **Integration testing**: Stable test environments
- **Staging environments**: Production-like testing platforms

### Infrastructure Services

Perfect for:
- **CI/CD runners**: Build and deployment systems
- **Monitoring infrastructure**: Metrics and logging systems
- **Network services**: DNS, DHCP, and other network services
- **Security services**: Firewalls, VPNs, and security appliances

## Libvirt Workflow Patterns

### Basic VM Creation

```bash
# Create a simple persistent VM
bcvk libvirt run quay.io/myapp/server:latest
```

**Benefits**:
- Automatic VM configuration
- Persistent storage
- Libvirt management integration
- Default resource allocation

### Production Service Deployment

```bash
# Deploy production service with specific resources
bcvk libvirt run \
  --name production-api \
  --memory 8192 \
  --cpus 4 \
  --autostart \
  quay.io/myapp/api:v1.0
```

**Benefits**:
- Named VM for identification
- Resource allocation control
- Automatic startup configuration
- Production-grade setup

### Development Environment Setup

```bash
# Create development environment with host integration
bcvk libvirt run \
  --name dev-environment \
  --memory 4096 \
  --cpus 2 \
  --network default \
  --ssh \
  quay.io/myapp/dev:latest
```

**Benefits**:
- Network connectivity
- SSH access for development
- Persistent development state
- Host integration capabilities

### Container Storage Integration

```bash
# Create VM with access to host container storage for bootc upgrades
bcvk libvirt run \
  --name upgrade-test \
  --bind-storage-ro \
  --ssh \
  quay.io/fedora/fedora-bootc:42
```

With this, a virtiofs mount named `hoststorage` is provisioned. There isn't
yet automatic mounting, but you can inject code to do so that performs
`mkdir -p /run/virtiofs-mnt-hoststorage && mount -t virtiofs hoststorage /run/virtiofs-mnt-hoststorage`.

Then on your host system after you've done a `podman build` that results in a new image `localhost/bootc`,
in the guest system you can point bootc to use it via e.g.
```
env STORAGE_OPTS=additionalimagestore=/run/virtiofs-mnt-hoststorage bootc switch --transport containers-storage localhost/bootc
```

You currently need to add the `STORAGE_OPTS` each time you invoke `bootc` - but there after e.g.
```
env STORAGE_OPTS=additionalimagestore=/run/virtiofs-mnt-hoststorage bootc upgrade
```

will work.
