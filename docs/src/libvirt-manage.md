# VM Lifecycle Management Concepts

Virtual machine lifecycle management encompasses the complete operational experience of VMs from creation to retirement. This guide covers the concepts, strategies, and workflows for effectively managing bootc-based libvirt VMs throughout their operational lifecycle.

## VM Lifecycle Overview

The VM lifecycle represents the journey of a virtual machine through various operational states, each requiring different management approaches and considerations.

### Lifecycle Stages

**Creation and Provisioning**: Initial VM setup and resource allocation
**Configuration and Deployment**: Application setup and service configuration
**Operation and Monitoring**: Day-to-day operational management
**Maintenance and Updates**: Ongoing system maintenance and updates
**Scaling and Optimization**: Performance tuning and resource adjustment
**Backup and Recovery**: Data protection and disaster recovery
**Migration and Evolution**: Moving and upgrading VMs
**Retirement and Cleanup**: End-of-life management and resource reclamation

## VM State Management

### VM States and Transitions

Understanding VM states is crucial for effective lifecycle management:

**Shutoff/Stopped**: VM is defined but not running
**Running**: VM is actively executing
**Paused**: VM execution is temporarily suspended
**Suspended**: VM state saved to disk, not consuming resources
**Crashed**: VM has encountered an error and stopped

### State Transition Strategies

**Graceful Operations**: Clean shutdowns and restarts preserve data integrity
**Forced Operations**: Emergency procedures for unresponsive VMs
**Scheduled Operations**: Planned maintenance and update procedures
**Automated Operations**: Policy-driven state management
