# Writing code

There is a `Justfile` that is the primary entrypoint to development. Read it, and avoid
executing commands other than `just <cmd>` by default. You may use readonly tools like `rg` etc.

NEVER execute `sudo <anything>` without explicit permission.

# Writing commits

Without explicit permission, don't create git commits, and DO NOT `git push`.
